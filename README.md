# Phishing URL Detection

**_**Introduction**_**

Phishing is a type of social engineering attack that is widely used by cybercriminals to steal sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card numbers, and personal data. Phishing attacks are one of the most dangerous threats to online accounts and data because these attacks pose as a trustworthy firm or person, and they employ social engineering techniques to make victims more likely to fall for the scam.

Phishing attacks have gotten increasingly complex, it is very difficult for an average person to determine if an email message link or website is legitimate. Cyber-attacks by criminals that employ phishing schemes are so prevalent and successful nowadays. Hence, this project seeks to address fake URLs and domain names by identifying phishing website links.
